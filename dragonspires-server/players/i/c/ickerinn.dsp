 Ickerinn of Aggamoth knelt in front of Sentara of the five diamonds as captain of the Seraphim-Human alliance. The last remaining rays of light from the setting sun reflected off of his blue eyes. His hair was a long, light blue that came down past his shoulders and he often wore it in a ponytail. He was to lead the expedition into the Wicked territory to uphold his allegiance and to ensure the safety of his people.
