# - npc3.conf
# - Configuration file for NPC3s!
# - (NPC3s = player/enemy sprite-based NPCs)
#
# An NPC3 definintion must start with an <npc3> and end with
# an </npc3>.
#
# Variables Explanations:
#
#
# name=<text>	
#	The name of the NPC3.
#
# color=<text>	
#	The NPC3's colorstring.
#
# map=#
#	The number of the map the NPC3 will be on.
#
# start=#,#
#	The coordinates where the NPC3 will start at.
#
# wander={true|false}
#	Whether or not this NPC3 will wander about the map.
#	If this is false, the NPC will simply stand.
#
# face=<dir>
#	dir = n[orth], s[outh], e[ast], w[est]
#	Which direction the NPC will face when it first
#	starts. This is optional and is usually only useful
#	for when an NPC3 does not wander.
#
# trigger_interval=#
#	How often the NPC3 will speak/wander. The higher the
#	value the less often the NPC3 will do stuff.
#
# random_speak={true|false}
#	Whether or not this NPC3 will say random things
#	every now and then. If this is true, then a
#	[random_speaks] block needs to be defined. Each line
#	within the [random_speaks] block represents the things
#	the NPC3 could say. Using %1 anywhere in a line will
#	be replaced by the NPC3's name by the server. End the
#	the [random_speaks] block with an [end].
#
# canhit={true|false}
# 	Whether or not this NPC3 will do something when it is
#	hit by a player. If true, then a [hits] block needs to
#	be defined. Each line is what the NPC3 could randomly
#	say. %1 = NPC3's name, %2 = player's name. Of course,
#	end the [hits] block with [end].
#
# interactable={true|false}
#	Whether or not the NPC3 is interactable. If true, then
#	the [interactions] block needs to be defined. The first
#	line in the [interactions] block is the first option the
#	interacting player has to choose from, and should start
#	with "1. " or something. In the options you can use a
#	';' to create a new line in the interaction window. The
#	second line in the block is the response the player
#	will get back if they choose the first option. This
#	pattern continues. End the block with [end]. Woo.
#
# interact_title=<text>
#	This is optional. This is to have a kind of
#	"description" for the NPC3 before the options. You can
#	leave the [interactions] block empty and still
#	define this if you want an NPC3 to only have a
#	description window and no interactions. Use ';' anywhere
#	in the text to create a new line in the window.
#
# An Added Bonus!:
# 	Now this gets weird, and optional. In the case of random
#	speak messages, hit messages, and interaction responses
#	you can use a ';' to create a new line in the data being
#	sent to the player. This means that in these little lines
#	you define here you can make things like a new line of
#	text on the player's screen(color or not), a "spell"
#	effect, a sound, and probably other things that I can't
#	think of, happen. To make a new line of text you'd do
#	something like this:
#	%1: Ouch that hurts!;(%1: You meanie, %2!
#	If you wanted to make a new line of red text you would
#	do this:
#	%1: Ouch that hurst!;["%1: NOW YOU WILL DIE, %2!
#	Other things are too crazy/complex to write down here.
#	Ask Mech if you want to do some crazy/complex stuff. Heh.
